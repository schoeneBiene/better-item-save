# Better Item Saver

Adds a way of saving items.

- **Saving**: Hold the item you want to save in your main hand and run ``/save-item-in-hand <location>``
- **Loading**: Open your inventory and press the "Better Item Saver" button in the top left, check the items you want to load and press "Give"

Note: This mod is currently pretty early in development and is still missing many things.
